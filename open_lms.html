                <h5>Mission Statement: </h5>
                <p>
                  Project "Open LMS" is an open learning management software designed to provide free school(s) for people to advance their knowledge. Education is the ultimate second chance that never quits. This education platform will be free for anyone, being commercial or personal. Everyone from traditional institutions to master craftsman will be able to provide a proper education with this software. Education should be free for anyone interested in improving their life. As well, education should be easy to find for those seeking improvement. This project should never stop, not for a thousand years. Hopefully it will make an impact in poverty, communities, spirituality, the unknown future, second chances for people to improve their situation, or individuals to study a master craftsman(s) work so that work will not be lost in time. Stability for an individual in their socio-economic driven society is based on a solid foundation of continuous learning. This software should not replace traditional institutions. But instead help continue education throughout the life of people despite economical resources. I believe this will strengthen tradition institutions as education will strengthen the economic means needed for traditional institutions to recieve students. This project should be the platform to improve the lives of everyone involved by providing a foundation for continuous education that can be provided with an open learning management software available to anyone. Education is viewed as a basic human right.

                </p>
                <h5>Special Note:</h5>
                <p>
                  Hopefully this project will never end. We need to come together with understanding. Only with an educated collective population we can establish the basic ethic(s) necessary for a peaceful life. With that being said, this platform should not be used for hate speech. No class of people should be discriminated against. All people should be allowed to live a positive life, bringing positive contributions to their respective community despite their past conditions before receiving a quality education. This platform is made available to everyone to advance their knowledge to future generations. But for me, as a christain, I am motivated by the bible quote: Luke 23:34 NIV.
